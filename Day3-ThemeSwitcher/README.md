Day 3 – React Theme Switcher

This project is part of my daily React learning journey.
On Day 3, I built a Theme Switcher application using React to understand state management, component structure, and basic styling concepts.

Project Overview

The Theme Switcher allows users to change the appearance of the application by switching between different themes.
It demonstrates how React can dynamically update the UI based on user interaction.
