# Day 1 - Hello React

## Overview
This is my very first React project!  
It’s a simple UI that displays a greeting message:  
**"Hello React, I'm Devanjali — this is my first component."**

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- Creating my first component (`App.jsx`)
- Rendering text inside the component

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to `Day1-HelloReact`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

## Notes
This project marks the beginning of my React learning journey.  
Each day I’ll add a new folder with a fresh project to show my growth step by step.
